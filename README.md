# Weather Project Readme

This is a simple project designed to help you learn how to deploy a website to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The project consists of two main features:

1. **Weather API Viewer (weather-api):** This feature allows you to fetch weather information using a JavaScript-based Weather API. You can enter a location, and the application will retrieve and display weather data for that location.

2. **Text Utils (text-utils):** The Text Utils feature provides two text transformation options - converting text to uppercase or lowercase. You can input text, select the desired transformation, and the application will generate the transformed text for you.

## How to Use

### Weather API Viewer

1. Click on the "Weather API" link in the navigation menu to access the Weather API Viewer.
2. Enter the name of a location you'd like to check the weather for.
3. Click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve and display weather information.

### Text Utils

1. Click on the "Text Utils" link in the navigation menu to access the Text Utils feature.
2. Enter the text you want to transform in the input field.
3. Select either "Uppercase" or "Lowercase" transformation.
4. Click the "Transform Text" button to generate the transformed text.

## Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. The deployment process is triggered automatically whenever you push changes to the `main` branch of this repository.

To enable GitHub Pages for this project:

1. Create a GitHub repository for your project.
2. Commit your project files to the repository, ensuring you have at least an `index.html` file for the web pages.
3. Navigate to the "Settings" tab of your repository.
4. Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
5. In the "Source" drop-down menu, select the "main" branch.
6. Click "Save" to enable GitHub Pages.

GitHub Actions will take care of the deployment for you. The deployed website will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name`.
